# ðŸ§  Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## ðŸ“Š Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using **unsupervised machine learning** with the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm.  
By analyzing customer behavior, we aim to group similar customers together for targeted marketing strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

- Group customers into meaningful segments based on their characteristics (e.g., Age, Income, Spending Score)
- Visualize the clusters to understand behavior patterns
- Help businesses target the right audience for marketing

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- **Source**: Mall Customer Dataset
- Contains features like:
  - `Gender`
  - `Age`
  - `Annual Income`
  - `Spending Score`

## ðŸš€ Project Steps

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection
3. Applying the **K-Means Clustering**
4. Using **Elbow Method** to find the optimal number of clusters
5. Visualizing the resulting clusters using scatter plots and pairplots

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Visualizations

- Spending Score vs Income (colored by cluster)
- Age vs Spending Score
- Cluster centers and boundaries

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- Segmented customers into X clusters (replace with actual number)
- Found patterns such as high-spending youth or low-spending elders
- Useful for targeting promotions
